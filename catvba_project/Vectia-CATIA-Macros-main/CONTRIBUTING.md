# Contributing to Vectia Tools

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Vectia Tools project!

## Current Status
This project is currently maintained by a single developer. The primary goal is to provide a stable and useful set of tools for the CATIA V5 community.

## How to Contribute
The best way to contribute right now is by providing feedback and suggestions. If you have an idea for a new feature, an improvement to an existing macro, or have found a bug, please feel free to open an "Issue" on the main repository page.

At this time, direct code contributions via pull requests are not the primary focus, but all ideas and discussions are welcome.
